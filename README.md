# Machine-Fault-Prediction

This is a Mutivariate Time Series Forecasting Project that I did.

The data consists of 4 columns which are sensor values of 4 sensors collected over 2 plus years along with their date-time index.

Implemented 3 models, VAR , VARMA , LSTM with RNN

Predicted the value for the next 3 days and built a system that detects if a fault is present in the next 3 days and alerts the management

Thus preventing failure of a Machine
